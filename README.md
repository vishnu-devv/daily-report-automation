A Python-based automation project that generates reports, processes data, and sends results via email automatically.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project automates the process of:
- Loading data
- Processing and analyzing it
- Generating visual reports
- Sending reports via email
- Logging all activities
- Handling errors safely

It is designed as a **real-world automation system** similar to business reporting pipelines.

# 🧠 Step-by-Step Development Journey (A to Z)

## 🔹 Stage 1: Basic Setup
- Created project folder structure
- Set up Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Installed required libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - openpyxl

---

## 🔹 Stage 2: Data Layer
- Built `data_loader.py`
- Created structured dataset using Pandas
- Designed reusable data pipeline

---

## 🔹 Stage 3: Report Generation
- Built `report_generator.py`
- Generated visual reports using Matplotlib
- Saved reports inside `/reports` folder

---

## 🔹 Stage 4: Email Automation
- Built `email_sender.py`
- Configured Gmail SMTP server
- Sent reports as email attachments
- Used Gmail App Password authentication

---

## 🔹 Stage 5: Configuration Management
- Created `config.py`
- Centralized all project settings:
  - Email credentials
  - File paths
  - SMTP configuration

---

## 🔹 Stage 6: Logging System
- Added logging using Python logging module
- Stored logs in `/logs/app.log`
- Tracked full workflow execution

---

## 🔹 Stage 7: Error Handling
- Added try/except blocks across modules
- Ensured system does not crash unexpectedly
- Logged all errors for debugging

---

## 🔹 Stage 8: Main Controller
- Created `main.py`
- Orchestrates entire workflow:
  1. Load data
  2. Generate report
  3. Send email
  4. Log results

---

## 🔹 Stage 9: Project Cleanup
- Modularized code into `/src`
- Removed hardcoded values
- Improved maintainability
- Added `.gitignore`

---

## 🔹 Stage 10: GitHub Publishing
- Initialized Git repository
- Created GitHub repository
- Pushed project for public access
- Prepared portfolio-ready structure

---

## 🔹 Stage 11 (Optional Upgrade)
- Designed for future web deployment (Streamlit / dashboard)
- Ready for scaling into enterprise automation

---
